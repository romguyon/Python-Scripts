As someone coming from Excel/VBA, the power of all the Python libraries is phenomenal (not to mention the massive number of StackOverflow material). Since I am in the process of converting over to Pandas I've been doing my best to try to stay within Python to get immersed in it, which I think is useful exercise.\n",

If you don't believe me create a custom function in Python that does something weird and try to troubleshoot it--sometimes it's just easier to be able to scroll through a Dataframe cell by cell without having to manually type in filters, etc. Yes you could use widgets or something along those lines to filter the data--but I'd rather use Excel, especially since working within a DataFrame I cut out a lot of the overhead in Excel if I am not using Excel formulas. _Enter the xlwings library!."
